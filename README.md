SetupBooster
==============
This project is a web application for managing a wiki of software configuration articles using the Makahiki framework.
Its eventual goal is to create a "serious game" using the Makahiki framework that teaches users how to use and 
contribute to the wiki, such that the system becomes partially self-documenting.

This application is not currently in a stable state.
