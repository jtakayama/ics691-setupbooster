					<h4>Overview</h4>
					<p>The goal of the SetupBooster project is to compress the essential
					principles of how to contribute to its Markdown-based wiki into a series
					of tutorial activities that are structured like a game. This idea is an
					attempt to address the problem with wikis and similar sites that build
					up a large body of "basic" policies over time: no one reads them until
					an administrator tells them they have broken one. While learning about
					policy is never going to be a very enjoyable activity, incorporating
					it into a rewards system provides an incentive for users. Limiting
					article creation to those who have completed the tutorial game or are
					administrators would increase the time commitment required from
					anyone who wants to fill the site with spam content.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="tutorial">
					<h4>Part 1: Tutorial Game</h4>
					<p>The tutorial game is divided into six subject categories of questions 
					and activities. The current list of planned activities is documented
					on the <a href="GameContent.html">Game Content</a> page. Completion
					of each question or activity earns points. Each question or activity
					requires the user to demonstrate comprehension of wiki policy or to
					use a simulation of a wiki user interface component to carry out a
					task. In the final version of this system, the user should be able to
					learn the basics of how the site works through the act of playing the
					tutorial game. The act of completing the tutorial game would earn a total
					of 175 points (including a badge given for completing the game).</p>

					<h5>Points Breakdown</h5>
					PLACEHOLDER
					<ul>
						<li>+10 per new article published</li>
						<li>+5 for being added as an editor to another article</li>
						<li>+3 for adding an editor to an article</li>
						<li>+3 each time their article gets a rating of 4 or higher</li>
						<li>+2 each time their article gets a rating of 3</li>
						<li>-3 each time their article gets a rating of 2 or lower</li>
						<li>-3 each time a user is reported to administrators and the complaint stands</li>
					</ul>
					PLACEHOLDER
					<h5>Star Ratings Breakdown</h5>
					PLACEHOLDER
					<p>Ratings will be limited to once per user per article per day.
						All articles start with a rating of 3 stars (average).
						Though what makes an article "good" can be very subjective,
						the following suggestions are provided:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>1 Star <div class="btn">&#x2606;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;</div>
								<ul>
									<li>The article provides no or almost no accurate information.</li>
									<li>The article provides no or almost no relevant information.</li>
									<li>Completing the instructions causes unexpected file loss,
									data corruption, or other problems not attributable
									to other causes, and the article did not warn of this possibility.
									(If this happens, it's recommended that you leave a comment that
									describes your problem.)</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>2 Stars <div class="btn">&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;</div>
								<ul>
									<li>The article is accurate but contains significant gaps in its instructions.</li>
									<li>The article provides some irrelevant information that detracts from readability
									or makes it hard to understand.</li>
									<li>Completing the instructions causes non-harmful side effects
									    which are not documented. (If this happens, it's recommended
									    that you leave a comment that describes your problem.)</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>3 Stars <div class="btn">&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2605;&#x2605;</div>
								<ul>
									<li>The article is missing some minor details but its instructions are otherwise complete.</li>
									<li>The article is understandable and organized.</li>
									<li>The article's instructions do not cause undocumented side effects,
									and the documented side effects are not harmful.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>4 Stars <div class="btn">&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2605;</div>
								<ul>
									<li>The article provides very precise instructions.</li>
									<li>The article contains clearly defined sections with a
									beginning, middle, and end.</li>
									<li>Side effects, if any, are documented and not harmful. 
									The necessity of the steps which cause them is justified.</li>
									<li>You judge this documentation to be of at least equal quality
									with comparable official documentation of the same feature (if this
									documentation exists).</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>5 Stars <div class="btn">&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;</div>
								<ul>
									<li>Like a four-star article, but somehow indefinably...better.
									(High-quality images can help push something over the edge.)</li>
									<li>You judge this documentation to be of better quality than
									comparable official documentation of the same feature, or it
									documents a feature which official documentation does not
									mention. (Note that using truly undocumented features can
									backfire, as such features may be unstable or slated for
									removal without warning in future versions.)</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
