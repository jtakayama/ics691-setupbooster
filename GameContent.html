					<p>SetupBooster's final implementation will provide a tutorial system that 
					   helps new users to learn about its wiki system by editing test 
					   articles and working with simulated user accounts. Completing
					   each tutorial activity earns points and badges along the way. 
					   Completing all activities earns a "Basic Training" badge, which
					   is required to edit articles. Sample text is provided
					   for each activity. (Submit buttons are non-functional and will 
					   just reload the page.)
					</p>
					<p>Note: The current early-stage implementation of the system does not support
					file uploads or many of the features of article editing.</p>
				</section>
				<!-- Activities 1 -->
				<section id="site-basics">
					<div class="page-header">
						<h4> Activities 1: Site Basics</h4>
						<p>The first category of activities deals with the basics of what
						the site is for and sets out the least someone needs to know
						about site policy (though it is not comprehensive). This largely
						consists of activities in which users read a short text (videos
						could be substituted) and have their answers to comprehension 
						questions be verified by administrators. </p>
						<h5>1. What Is A Wiki? (5 points)</h5>
						<p>
							A wiki is a website with articles that can be edited by any
							of its members at any time. The ideal of a wiki is to provide
							a platform for users to share knowledge with others by creating
							and improving articles. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">Wikipedia</a>
							is one of the largest and best-known examples of this kind of site.
						</p>
						<hr/>
						<p>	In general, should anyone be able to edit a wiki article?<br/>
						    <form action="#" method="GET">
						    <input type="radio" name="choices" value="Yes"/> Yes<br/>
						    <input type="radio" name="choices" value="No"/> No<br/>
						    <input type="submit"/><br/>
						    </form>
						    (Correct answer: Yes)
						</p>
						<hr/>
						<h5>2. What is SetupBooster? (5 points)</h5>
						<p>SetupBooster is designed to be a wiki for software articles organized
						   by version, operating system, subject, and tags indicating article content.
						   A problem of many help sites is that it's difficult to determine what version
						   of the software is being referred to and what platform it's supposed to be on.
						   It's also sometimes difficult to contact the person who wrote the article
						   if you have more specific questions, or if the solution for whatever reason
						   doesn't work for you. SetupBooster allows guides to be updated and the
						   original authors to be contacted if you have problems.</p>
						 <p>SetupBooster is not a bug reporting system; those should
						 	be handled by the actual developers. However, it can be a place to tell people how you
						 	got around a bug or took advantage of an undocumented feature.</p>
						 <p>SetupBooster is not a place to complain about things unless you've found
						    a way to fix them.</p>
						 <hr/>
						 <p>
						 	SetupBooster articles should: <br/>
						    <form action="#" method="GET">
						    <input type="radio" name="choices" value="1"/> 1. Tell people how to do things with a specific application, API, or other software<br/>
						    <input type="radio" name="choices" value="2"/> 2. Report bugs or design issues without describing a workaround<br/>
						    <input type="radio" name="choices" value="3"/> 3. Complain about things you don't like<br/>
						    <input type="submit"/><br/>
						    </form>
						    (Answer: 1.)
						  </p>
						  <hr/>
						  <h5>3. Is It Original? (10 points)</h5>
						  <p>Unlike Wikipedia, a lot of what is posted on SetupBooster will
						  fall under "original research" - things users figured out how to do
						  on their own. However, if your article does use other sources as reference
						  or combines and organizes content from many other, less comprehensive
						  articles on other sites or in printed guides, it's important to
						  give credit where credit is due.</p>
						  <p>Setupbooster uses the APA (American Psychological Association) format.
						  The Purdue Owl's <a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/10/">Reference List: Electronic Sources (Web Publications)</a>
						  is a good place to start.</p>
						  <hr/>
						  <p>You are citing a post on the online forum &quot;Queue Overload&quot;
						  with the title "World Simulator keeps crashing and forcing me to
						  restart from scratch," by a user with the screen name "John Doe."
						  It is Post 1 in the thread, posted on October 25, 2012. The URL
						  of the post is http://queueoverload.com/questions/134021605/world-simulator-keeps-crashing.
						  How would you write this citation?</p>
						  <form action="#" method="GET">
						    <textarea name="citation" rows="10" cols="80"></textarea><br/>
						    <input type="submit"/><br/>
						   </form>
						  (The answer to a question like this would probably need to be reviewed manually.)<br/>
						  <pre>
Doe, J. (2012, October 25). World Simulator keeps 
	crashing and forcing me to restart from scratch
	[Msg 1]. Message posted to http://queueoverload
	.com/questions/134021605/world-simulator-keeps-
	crashing</pre>
						  <hr/>
						  <h5>4. Acceptable Content (5 points)</h5>
						  SetupBooster has some rules on user-generated content (which covers most things here).
						  Please acknowledge that you have read and understood the <a href="#" title="Not a real link">terms and conditions</a>.
						  <hr/>
						  I have read and understood the terms and conditions that govern my use of this site.
						  By selecting "Yes" and submitting this answer, I accept the terms and conditions
						  (if I have not done so previously).
						  <form action="#" method="GET">
						    <input type="radio" name="choices" value="Yes"/> Yes<br/>
						    <input type="radio" name="choices" value="No"/> No<br/>
						    <input type="submit"/><br/>
						  </form>
						    (Answer: Yes. The user should be presented with the terms and conditions
						    during the signup process; this adds another level of redundancy.)
						  <hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
				<!-- Activities 2 -->
				<section id="article-basics">
					<div class="page-header">
						<h4> Activities 2: Articles</h4>
						<p>The second category of activities deals with the basics of creating
						and editing articles.  Sample text is provided
						for each activity. (Submit buttons are non-functional and will 
						just reload the page.)</p>
						<hr/>
						<h5>1. What Articles Are (5 points)</h5>
						<p>The purpose of articles on SetupBooster is to provide instructions
						to accomplish a task or solve a problem using an application, API,
						or other software. Articles are not meant to be editorials or
						places to complain about things unless the article can demonstrate
						a solution for a particular version or versions of the software.</p>
						<hr/>
						<p>True or false: SetupBooster articles should be used to complain about
						any issue which annoys you, and you do not have to implement a solution.</p>
						<form action="#" method="GET">
						    <input type="radio" name="choices" value="True"/> True<br/>
						    <input type="radio" name="choices" value="False"/> False<br/>
						    <input type="submit"/><br/>
						</form>
						(Answer: False)
						<hr/>
						<h5>Learn to Format: Markdown Basics (10 points)</h5>
						<p>SetupBooster articles use Markdown syntax. The full documentation
						can be found at <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Daring Fireball</a>.
						</p>
						<hr/>
						<p>Read the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">Markdown "Basics" page</a>,
						then mimic the formatting of the following text:<br/>
						<h1>This is a top-level header.</h1>
						<p>This is a paragraph, and...</p>
						<p>...this is another paragraph.</p>
						<h2>This is a second-level header.</h2>
						<p>This is a paragraph. Some of the text has <strong>strong emphasis</strong>.</p>
						<blockquote>This is a blockquote, with some of the text <em>emphasized</em>.</blockquote>
						</p>
						<form action="#" method="GET">
						    <textarea name="citation" rows="10" cols="80"></textarea><br/>
						    <input type="submit"/><br/>
						</form>
						(Answer is below. The * and ** emphasis would also be accepted.)
						<pre>
This is a top-level header.
===========================
This is a paragraph, and...

This is another paragraph.
This is a second-level header.
------------------------------

This is a paragraph. Some of the text has __strong emphasis__.
> This is a blockquote, with some of the text _emphasized_.
						</pre>
						<hr/>
						<h5>3. Your First Article (10 points)</h5>
						Before publishing an article, it's a good idea to
						test it out in the sandbox, a special area where each
						user can write up drafts.
						<hr/>
						Type "Test" as the article title, select "Linux"
						as the Operating System, and type "Other" as the subject.
						<form action="#" method="GET">
						    Title: <input type="text" name="title" size="30" maxlength="250"/><br/>
						    Operating System: <select name="os_menu" size="3">
						    	<option value="windows">Windows</option>
						    	<option value="macosx">Mac OS X</option>
						    	<option value="linux">Linux</option>
						    	<option value="bsd">BSD</option>
						    	<option value="android">Android</option>
						    	<option value="ios">iOS</option>
						    	<option value="other">Other</option>
						    	</select><br/>
						    Subject: <input type="text" name="subject" size="30" maxlength="250"/>
						    <input type="submit"/><br/>
						</form>
						<hr/>
						<h5>4. Start to Make It Better (10 points)</h5>
						<p>Assuming you named your article "Test" in the previous activity,
						click <a href="#">here</a> to go to your new article. Make any change at all,
						then come back to this page and click "Submit Query."</p>
						<form action="#" method="GET">
							<input type="submit"/>
						</form>
						<hr/>
						<h5>5. Publish It (5 points)</h5>
						<p>Once you're done editing an article, click its Publish
						button to make it visible to everyone. This is a demo button,
						so pressing it won't do anything this time.
						</p>
						<div class="btn">Publish</div><br/>
						You can still edit an article after publishing it.
						<p>Click "Submit Query" to finish this activity.</p>
						<form action="#" method="GET">
							<input type="submit"/>
						</form>
						<hr/>
						<h5>6. Tag, That's It (10 points)</h5>
						<p>You can add tags to your articles to make them more
						easily searchable. Tags are added via a comma-separated
						string of values, e.g.:
						<pre>xml,parser,semantic-web,singularity,self-replicating,sentient,buzzword</pre>
						</p>
						<hr/>
						Tag your "Test" article with "setup" and "guide."
						<form action="#" method="GET">
						    Add tags: <input type="text" name="add-tags" size="30" maxlength="250"/><br/>
						    <input type="submit"/><br/>
						</form>
						(Answer: setup,guide)
						<hr/>
						<h5>7. Comments, Anyone? (5 points)</h5>
						<p>In addition to the rating system (which we'll cover later), comments
						are another, more detailed means of letting users know that you
						like their articles or have a suggestion for improving them.</p>
						<hr/>
						Add a comment on your own article (plain text):
						<form action="#" method="GET">
							Comment by <strong>username</strong> on article <strong>Test</strong>:<br/>
						    <textarea name="comment-field" rows="10" cols="80"></textarea><br/>
						    <input type="submit"/><br/>
						</form>
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
				<!-- Article extras -->
				<section id="article-extras">
					<div class="page-header">
						<h4> Activities 3: Article Extras</h4>
						<p>These short activities cover some extra things users
						can add to their articles, which demonstrate combinations
						of Markup with HTML. Alternately, since Markup allows HTML,
						clicking "view source" on the question page is a perfectly
						acceptable way to find the answer.</p>
						<hr/>
						<h5>1. Embed Media Files (5 points)</h5>
						Markup syntax supports any media file embeds you could make with 
						regular HTML. To embed an image, use the &lt;img&gt; tag.
						<hr/>
						Type the code to embed the image in (SITE URL HERE)/test.png with 
						title text "TEST", as shown below:<br/>
						<img src="images/test.png" title="TEST"/><br/><br/>
						<form action="#" method="GET">
						    <textarea name="text-field" rows="1" cols="50"></textarea><br/>
						    <input type="submit"/><br/>
						</form>
						You can also use HTML to embed videos and other media files.
						<br/>(Answer:)
						<pre>&lt;img src=&quot;images/test.png&quot; title=&quot;TEST&quot;/&gt;</pre>
						<hr/>
						<h5>2. Upload Files (5 points)</h5>
						SetupBooster supports non-executable file uploads of less than
						20 MB in size. The upload form looks like this:
						<form action="#" method="GET">
							<textarea name="text-field" rows="1" cols="100"></textarea>
							<div class="btn">Browse</div><br/>
							<div class="btn">Upload</div>
						</form>
					    For a list of supported file types, see the <a href="#" title="Not a real link">full list</a>.
						Click "Submit Query" to finish this activity.
						<form action="#" method="GET">
						    <input type="submit"/><br/>
						</form>
					</div>
				</section>
				<!-- User Basics -->
				<section id="user-basics">
					<div class="page-header">
						<h4> Activities 4: About Users</h4>
						<hr/>
						<h5>1. Types of Users (5 points)</h5>
						<p>SetupBooster has two types of users: normal users
						and administrators. Normal users can create articles,
						edit articles, delete their own articles (if they are 
						the only listed editor), and rate articles that they 
						are not listed as editors of. Administrators can ban 
						users, edit or delete any article, and nominate new 
						administrators.</p>
						For another version of this explanation, see the 
						<a href="#" title="Not a real link">
						About User Types</a> page. Click "Submit Query" 
						to finish this activity.
						<form action="#" method="GET">
							<input type="submit"/><br/>
						</form>
						<hr/>
						<h5>2. Messaging (5 points)</h5>
						<p>Registered users can leave messages for each other using
						the "Send Message" tool on their own page.
						<hr/>
						Send the message "Hello" to user <strong>tutorialRobot</strong>:<br/>
						<form action="#" method="GET">
							Send to user: <textarea name="sendto" rows="1" cols="50"></textarea><br/>
							<textarea name="message" rows="10" cols="80"></textarea><br/>
							<input type="submit"/><br/>
						</form>
						<hr/>
						<h5>3. Reporting (5 points)</h5>
						<p>If a user has violated the <a href="#" title="Not a real link">terms and conditions</a>,
						submit a complaint via the "Report User" tool on your page. Once your report
						is accepted or rejected, you will receive a message.
						<hr/>
						Report the user <strong>antimatterRobot:</strong>
						<form action="#" method="GET">
							Report user: <textarea name="reportuser" rows="1" cols="50"></textarea><br/>
							Reason:<br/><textarea name="reason" rows="20" cols="80"></textarea><br/>
							<input type="submit"/><br/>
						</form>
						<hr/>
						<h5>4. User Points (5 points)</h5>
						<p>By now you've probably noticed that you've been getting
						   points for finishing all of these tutorials. These points
						   are part of how SetupBooster ranks its users. In addition
						   to these points, users earn:
						   <ul>
						   		<li>+10 per new article</li>
						   		<li>+5 for being added as an editor to another article</li>
						   		<li>+3 for adding an editor to an article</li>
						   		<li>+3 each time their article gets a rating of 4 or higher</li>
						   		<li>+2 each time their article gets a rating of 3</li>
						   		<li>-3 each time their article gets a rating of 2 or lower</li>
						   		<li>-3 each time a user is reported to administrators and the complaint stands</li>
						   </ul>
						   For a more comprehensive explanation, see the <a href="#" title="Not a real link">
						   Points page</a>. Click "Submit Query" to earn 5 more points.
						   <form action="#" method="GET">
						    <input type="submit"/><br/>
						   </form>
						</p>
						<h5>5. User Badges (5 points)</h5>
						<p>Badges are awarded for completing certain milestone tasks (e.g.,
						publishing your first article, being added as an editor for the first
						time, getting over 100 points, etc.) Badges are worth values
						that are multiples of 5 points. Finishing all of the tutorials
						earns a "Basic Training" badge worth 20 points.</p>
