					<h4>Overview</h4>
					<p>When Setupbooster is complete, it could be tested by emailing volunteers a link to
					the demonstration instance. Once volunteers had created accounts and logged on, 
					the site would direct them to begin the tutorial. To fully test the system's use of
					gamification elements, the playtesting would also need to cover the creation and
					rating of articles.</p>
				</section>

					<h4>Normal User Testing</h4>

				<section id="admin-test">
					<h4>Administrator Testing</h4>
					<p>Like any points-based system, it is probable that the points system can and will be
					gamed. As the plan for the final implementation of the system currently stands, all
					new users, once they have completed the Basic Training badge, will start their wiki
					experience with 155 points, plus 20 more for the badge, for a total of 175. Creating
					articles earns 10 points, which can be negated by negative ratings. 
					<p>Three of the possible issues are likely to involve behavior which it would be an
					administrator's job to handle. There is likely to be a need for separate testing
					with users who are granted administrator rights over a pool of users that are
					actually being "played" by one or more of the people conducting the research.
					In this scenario, administrator behavior, and not normal user behavior, is being
					tested.</p>
					<p>There are several potential issues:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>It's theoretically possible to spam short articles that are never read and
						never rated by anyone, earning 10 points for creating each one.</strong> There is 
						nothing intrinsically wrong with creating many unread articles: not every article 
						will be popular. In theory, however, an editor or group of editors could create 
						large numbers of blank or nearly-blank articles with the intention of
					    their never being read, earning 10 points for each one. It would be difficult to do
						this in the early days of a wiki instance when there would be fewer articles and this
						behavior would stand out more, but on a high-activity instance it would be less
						obvious. There will be badges (with points) awarded for creating certain multiples
						of five articles (5, 10, 20, etc.), which would provide an additional cushion against
						some of the low-quality spam articles being found and downvoted. This is compounded
						by a current technical limitation: all articles are created as blank with a title,
						then edited later.
							<ul>
								<li>This could be tested by nominating administrators, then arranging for
								someone to pose as a normal user while creating many spam articles. The
								goal would be to see how quickly administrators would detect something
								like this against the background noise of normal wiki activity.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>A spambot could become the highest-ranked user.</strong> This would be
						caught by the administrators once it happened, but might reflect badly on the perceived
						quality of the user base.
							<ul>
								<li>This could be tested by creating an actual bot, or selecting a group of
								people to pose as one, posting at regular intervals, and measuring how
								long it took for this activity to be detected.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Groups of editors could form alliances to upvote each others' content and
						downvote that of others.</strong> This would be difficult for administrators to detect, and
						difficult to deal with fairly - especially if administrators were part of the groups,
						or the groups involved were some of the most frequent contributors to the site. However,
						this is more of a people problem than a technical problem and would need to be dealt with
						by administrators.
							<ul>
								<li>This would be difficult to test, as it would require large number of
								subjects (or a few subjects posing as many users) to be using the demonstration
								instance in the first place.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
